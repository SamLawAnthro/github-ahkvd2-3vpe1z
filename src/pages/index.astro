        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-loose">My research interests center around autonomous social movements in Mexico City. Through ethnographic research, I aim to understand how these movements construct alternative forms of social organization and power. Specifically, I am interested in the strategies and practices that these movements use to build and sustain autonomy, the relationship between these movements and the state, and the broader implications of these movements for social and political change. By studying autonomous social movements in Mexico City, I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of how marginalized communities can organize and resist structures of oppression.</p>

            <p class="text-white mb-4">This article examines how the Panchos, a group of land occupiers in Mexico City, have created eight autonomous communities that challenge the dominant urban order. Drawing on Ivan Illich's critique of institutionality and recent theories of destituent power, the article shows how the Panchos practice a communal and dignified form of life that refuses and abandons the state and its institutions. The article argues that the Panchos' destituent praxis is an example of emancipatory politics that builds alternative ways of living in the present.</p>

              <p class="text-white mb-4">This article examines how the Comunidad Habitacional Acapatzingo, an autonomous community of around 3,000 people in the peripheries of Mexico City, has transformed from a squatted land filled with rubble into a space of urban autonomy and communal life. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and the concept of destituent power, the author analyzes how the community has developed its own forms of organization, communication, education, health care, and agriculture that challenge the dominant modes of urban governance and capitalism. The article argues that autonomy is not a fixed state or goal, but a dynamic process of creating and sustaining other worlds and communal forms of life in the face of multiple threats and challenges.</p>

              <p class="text-white mb-4">This paper examines how the urban poor in three informal communities in Argentina, M&eacute;xico, and Ecuador cope with poverty and insecurity. It uses ethnographic data to explore the role of kinship, friendship, patronage, and collective action in their problem-solving strategies. It also compares their experiences with the pioneering studies of survival strategies by Lomnitz and Stack. It argues that poor people&apos;s survival strategies are embedded in everyday political processes.</p>
